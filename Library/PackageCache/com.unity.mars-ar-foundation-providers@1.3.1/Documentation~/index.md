## MARS and AR Foundation
Use MARS AR Foundation Providers to support MARS applications on smartphones and AR HMDs. This package contains a set of wrapper classes for AR Foundation to manage the AR Session and update the MARS database with device data.

This package also makes MARS's simulation system available as an [AR Subsystem](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arsubsystems@3.1/manual/index.html), allowing you to run AR Foundation projects in the Editor using simulated data.
