# Unity MARS Editor Extension and Mobile Companion: Privacy Guidelines and Product Features
Privacy is an evolving area of law that can be difficult to navigate when creating games and new features for your players.  Unity is providing these product guidelines to assist you in your efforts to comply with applicable privacy laws, and we suggest that you review your implementation with your counsels.
## Major Privacy Considerations for use of MARS and MARS Companion App
### Camera Consent
The use of the camera and associated object measurements captured by our algorithms are important areas to focus on in your privacy policies and configuration of MARS features.  As always, native consent for camera access is required for camera usage; however, you should also consider that the object measurement in this instance may require an additional robust consent for collection under the General Data Protection Regulation and the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, among others.  The reason is at times the measurement taken will be the measurement of a face.  While we are not providing the ability to "tag" and identify specific users with this technology, the measurements taken to make the blunt distinctions between a player's face and other objects they are interacting with in the real world may amount to biometric information under the broad definitions of certain privacy laws.  The GDPR and Illinois' BIPA as examples have very specific consent requirements for such situations, and you will need to consider capturing the users' consent prior to their use of features you develop with MARS.
### Player Access and Deletion Requests
MARS Companion App does allow you to store the data you collect through the App and sync your data back to your machine for purposes of complying with access and deletion requests.  
### Data Retention and Minimisation
Please take care to note specific rules on storage of data under applicable data privacy laws.  For example, consider setting retention periods on the data you collect in order to comply with legal limitations set by data protection laws.  
### Data Security
When acting as your storage provider, Unity has developed a set of security controls that are appropriate for the sensitivity of the data you are collecting.  These controls include {Get list from security}.

Finally, the above guidelines are not intended as legal advice nor as an exhaustive list of issues.  You should consult your own legal advisers to assure full compliance.
