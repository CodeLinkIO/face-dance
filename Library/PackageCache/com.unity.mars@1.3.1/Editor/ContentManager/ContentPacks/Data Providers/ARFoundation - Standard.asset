    not provide access to prerelease features such as Body Tracking.


    AR Foundation
    is our core AR framework specifically designed for enabling multiplatform AR
    experiences. Unity MARS is built on top of the Unity Editor and works in coordination
    with AR Foundation. It exists as an additional layer that takes advantage of
    the data from AR Foundation or other custom data providers to allow creators
    to build for multiple platforms in a more streamlined and intuitive way.'
