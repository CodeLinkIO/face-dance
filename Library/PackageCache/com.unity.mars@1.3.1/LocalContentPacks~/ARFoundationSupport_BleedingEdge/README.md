# Unity MARS AR Foundation Support - Bleeding Edge

This package includes as dependencies the latest pre-release set of AR Foundation packages used by MARS.

AR Foundation is our core AR framework specifically designed for enabling multiplatform AR experiences. Unity MARS is built on top of the Unity Editor and works in coordination with AR Foundation. It exists as an additional layer that takes advantage of the data from AR Foundation or other custom data providers to allow creators to build for multiple platforms in a more streamlined and intuitive way.
